mihonapp#mihon#2345,"In the mihon app, the app would crash when the user tapped the filter button (opened the filter sheet) while their library/favorites was empty. This happened from the library screen when there were no items or categories to operate on. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: which file or module contained the bug, and what went wrong (the underlying programming mistake or missing guard) that caused the crash.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/library/LibraryScreenModel.kt (module: eu.kanade.tachiyomi.ui.library.LibraryScreenModel). The predicted root cause reason is accessing the active category without handling an empty category list (out-of-bounds / missing null check on activeCategory), causing a crash when the library has no categories/items."
mihonapp#mihon#2081,"In the mihon app, there was an intermittent crash where the app would unexpectedly terminate after being open for some time and while interacting with the UI (for example during screen transitions or animations such as when using a date selection UI). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this crash: determine which file or module was changed to fix the problem and explain the underlying reason why the app was crashing (what went wrong).",The predicted root cause component is gradle/libs.versions.toml (the voyager library dependency / voyager module version). The predicted root cause reason is a bug in the older voyager library version's lifecycle handling which attempted an invalid lifecycle state transition on a destroyed screen lifecycle owner (causing an IllegalStateException); updating the voyager dependency to a newer version resolved the issue.
mihonapp#mihon#2035,"In the mihon app, there was a crash when attempting to change the source sort order from the filters menu while browsing a source (for example, Pixiv). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: which file/module contains the defect, and what went wrong that allowed this crash to occur.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/browse/source/browse/SourceFilterDialog.kt (Module: eu.kanade.tachiyomi.ui.browse.source.browse.SourceFilterDialog). The predicted root cause reason is a missing null-handling for the filter state (dereferencing filter.state / using filter.state!! when there is no pre-selection), leading to a NullPointerException or invalid state access when no prior selection exists."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#9644,In thunderbird-android there was a crash when a user opened the app after it had been backgrounded and tapped a newly shown expandable “[gmail]” placeholder folder in the navigation drawer. The placeholder appears where normal Gmail folders normally are; tapping that placeholder causes the app to crash. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this crash.,"The predicted root cause component is feature/navigation/drawer/dropdown/src/main/kotlin/net/thunderbird/feature/navigation/drawer/dropdown/domain/usecase/GetDisplayTreeFolder.kt (Module: net.thunderbird.feature.navigation.drawer.dropdown.domain.usecase.GetDisplayTreeFolder).  The predicted root cause reason is that placeholder folders were created with a non-null placeholder accountId (and the display entity expected a valid account id), so click handling treated the placeholder as a real account folder and attempted to open it — a missing/nullability guard / incorrect placeholder account id handling caused the crash."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#9453,"In the Thunderbird for Android app, after installing the latest beta the app crashes on startup and cannot be opened. Opening the app immediately triggers the failure. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that caused this startup crash: specify the file/module where the bug originates and explain what went wrong (the underlying programming/state error) that led to the app failing on start.","The predicted root cause component is legacy/ui/legacy/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messagelist/MessageListSwipeCallback.kt (Module: com.fsck.k9.ui.messagelist.MessageListSwipeCallback). The predicted root cause reason is missing handling for a 'None' swipe action: the code attempted to create a SwipeActionConfig for accounts whose swipe action was SwipeAction.None, which led to an IllegalStateException / crash (state not filtered/validated before creating the config)."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#9318,"In thunderbird-android, the app crashes when the device orientation is changed (rotating the phone between portrait and landscape). This happens as the app attempts to update the UI (navigation drawer / message list) after rotation and results in an immediate crash instead of completing the orientation change. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: which file or module was responsible for the crash, and what went wrong that allowed the crash to occur.",The predicted root cause component is legacy/ui/legacy/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/activity/MessageList.kt (Module: com.fsck.k9.activity.MessageList). The predicted root cause reason is a NullPointerException caused by accessing nullable properties (account and/or search) without null checks in configureDrawer() during orientation changes (missing null checks / unsafe use of non-null assertions).
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#9236,"In thunderbird-android, there was a formatting bug when replying to messages with the ""Reply quoting style"" set to ""Header (like Outlook)"". When composing a reply the header block showed the Sent line correctly, but the From, To and Subject values were printed on the next line with an extra blank line after each, instead of appearing on the same line as their labels and with the next line immediately following. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this incorrect header formatting.","The predicted root cause component is legacy/core/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/message/quote/HtmlQuoteCreator.java (Module: com.fsck.k9.message.quote.HtmlQuoteCreator). The predicted root cause reason is that the header generation used a block-level HTML element (DIV) for the quoted header, which introduced unwanted newlines/blank lines; the fix changes the generator to use an inline element (SPAN) via the HTML converter to prevent those extra line breaks."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#9212,"In thunderbird-android (K-9 Mail), there was a bug where non-English folder names (for example Cyrillic names) appeared as ""?"" symbols in the folder list after creating an account and opening the folder list. The incorrect characters showed up in the UI instead of the expected folder names. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is mail/protocols/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapResponseParser.java (Module: com.fsck.k9.mail.store.imap.ImapResponseParser). The predicted root cause reason is that IMAP literal data containing UTF-8 bytes was interpreted/decoded as US-ASCII (missing/incorrect handling of UTF-8 for literals), causing non-ASCII characters to be corrupted and displayed as question marks."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#9194,"In thunderbird-android, users reported that after adding a Fastmail account (via OAuth), enabling notifications and push sync, and allowing background power, the app would work for a few hours but then show an ""Authentication failed"" notification and repeatedly prompt the user to re-login. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to these repeated authentication failures and token expiry behavior.","The predicted root cause component is mail/protocols/smtp/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/transport/smtp/SmtpTransport.kt (module: com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.smtp) together with the OAuth provider interface and implementation changes in mail/common/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/oauth/OAuth2TokenProvider.kt (module: com.fsck.k9.mail.oauth) and legacy/common/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backends/RealOAuth2TokenProvider.kt (module: com.fsck.k9.backends.RealOAuth2TokenProvider). The predicted root cause reason is a username mismatch / missing primary-email handling for OAuth XOAUTH2 authentication: the code used the account's entered username instead of the primary email extracted from the id_token (the OAuth provider), so authentication was rejected and tokens were invalidated prematurely (i.e., missing/incorrect handling of primaryEmail in the token provider and SMTP auth flow)."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#8138,"In thunderbird-android, importing settings from another mail app failed: when starting with a fresh profile and choosing Settings → Import → Import from app → K-9 Mail, the import failed and the UI showed “Failed to read settings file”. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that allowed this failure to occur (which file/module is responsible and what went wrong).","The predicted root cause component is feature/settings/import/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/feature/settings/import/ui/ImportAppFetcher.kt (Module: app.k9mail.feature.settings.import.ui.ImportAppFetcher). The predicted root cause reason is that the code did not check/apply minimum-version compatibility for supported apps (missing version compatibility check / missing logic to mark/disable apps that are too old), so the app attempted to import from an older app that doesn't support exporting settings, causing the import to fail."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#7739,"In thunderbird-android, there was an app crash when adding a new email account: when a user attempted to add an address during account creation the app crashed instead of proceeding normally. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason",The predicted root cause component is app-k9mail/dependencies/releaseRuntimeClasspath.txt (Module: app.k9mail.dependencies.releaseRuntimeClasspath) and the dependency declaration in gradle/libs.versions.toml (Module: gradle.libs.versions). The predicted root cause reason is a buggy third-party DNS library version (minidns 1.0.4) used at runtime that caused the crash during account setup; the issue was resolved by upgrading the minidns dependency to 1.0.5.
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#7705,"In the thunderbird-android repository/app, there was a crash that occurred when a user tried to unmask (toggle visibility of) a password field in Settings → Account settings → Fetching mail → Incoming server → Password unhide. The crash appeared in certain device/OS configurations (accessibility service enabled, older Android versions). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is core/ui/compose/designsystem/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/core/ui/compose/designsystem/atom/textfield/TextFieldOutlinedPassword.kt (module: app.k9mail.core.ui.compose.designsystem.atom.textfield.TextFieldOutlinedPassword). The predicted root cause reason is that password semantics were applied in a way that triggered an Android accessibility framework bug on API level 25 and below when the password visibility state changed (i.e., an unconditional/mis-scoped semantics.password usage / missing API-level guard caused a crash when accessibility services interacted with the Compose semantics)."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#6980,"In thunderbird-android, some IMAP folders appeared empty when opened even though the app showed unread messages for those folders; using the search function briefly made the messages visible, but removing the search returned the folder to an empty view. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is core/common/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/core/common/mail/EmailAddress.kt (Module: app.k9mail.core.common.mail.EmailAddress) and the related email address parsing code (core/common/src/main/kotlin/app/k9mail/core/common/mail/EmailAddressParser.kt and EmailAddressParserConfig.kt). The predicted root cause reason is that the email address parser was too strict and threw an exception for email addresses violating the specification (e.g. local part exceeding 64 characters); code paths called the strict toEmailAddress() (which throws) instead of using a tolerant/null-safe variant, causing parser exceptions that prevented the message list from loading (missing tolerant parsing / missing handling of parse failures)."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#6843,"In thunderbird-android, there was a bug in the message compose UI: when a user pasted or typed a recipient that included a display name with accented or other non-ASCII characters (for example: ""Tomáš Marný"" <tomas@example.com>), the field was marked invalid and an error stating that special characters are not supported was shown, even though the email address itself was valid. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/ui/legacy/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/view/RecipientSelectView.java (module: com.fsck.k9.view.RecipientSelectView). The predicted root cause reason is that the code validated ASCII on the entire user input (including the display/name portion) instead of parsing out the email address and validating only the address part, causing valid recipient strings with non-ASCII display names to be rejected (i.e., improper input validation / missing parsing that separates name and email address)."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#6062,"In thunderbird-android, there was an SMTP account setup failure: when configuring the outgoing SMTP server the setup stopped with an error dialog saying ""EHLO keyword contains invalid character"" while the app was reading the server's EHLO/HELO response. This happened during the outgoing server setup step after entering the SMTP host, security and authentication details. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is mail/protocols/smtp/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/transport/smtp/SmtpResponseParser.kt (com.fsck.k9.mail.transport.smtp.SmtpResponseParser). The predicted root cause reason is that the EHLO response parser treated malformed/unsupported EHLO keyword/parameter lines as a fatal parser error (calling parserError / throwing SmtpResponseParserException) instead of ignoring them — i.e. missing handling (try/catch/ignore) for invalid EHLO response lines, causing setup to fail."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#5922,"In thunderbird-android, users observed that incoming mail notifications no longer vibrated or lit the notification LED after updating to the reported version. This happened when notifications were enabled, vibration was set to default, and notification light was enabled — yet no vibration or LED happened when mail arrived. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to notifications becoming silent / losing vibration and LED behavior.","The predicted root cause component is app/core/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/notification/NotificationChannelManager.kt (module: com.fsck.k9.notification.NotificationChannelManager). The predicted root cause reason is that notification channels were recreated/managed in a way that did not preserve vibration and LED settings (i.e., the channel was recreated with incorrect/default importance or without copying vibration/light settings), causing notifications to be treated as silent and lose vibration/LED behavior."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#5397,"In thunderbird-android (K-9 Mail), there was a bug where enabling Push caused the device to stay awake for long periods (awake time continually increasing) instead of sleeping between mail checks. This happened when the app used IMAP IDLE to wait for new mail; after enabling Push the device did not go back to sleep and wake locks appeared to be held while the IDLE connection was active. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is mail/protocols/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/RealImapConnection.java (module: com.fsck.k9.mail.store.imap.RealImapConnection) and the IMAP folder idler implementation mail/protocols/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/RealImapFolderIdler.kt (module: com.fsck.k9.mail.store.imap.RealImapFolderIdler). The predicted root cause reason is an unreliable data-availability check (isDataAvailable() using InputStream.available()) which returned misleading results; this caused the code to skip releasing the wakelock and not schedule an IDLE refresh, resulting in the wakelock being held for the entire IDLE period."
thunderbird#thunderbird-android#5026,"In the thunderbird-android repository, users reported that deleting messages from the inbox appeared to work (messages disappear), but after quitting and reopening the app the messages were still in the inbox instead of being moved to Trash. This happened with IMAP accounts and could occur for messages that lacked some headers. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to deleted messages not being moved to the Trash (i.e., which file/module needed to be changed and what went wrong logically).","The predicted root cause component is app/storage/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/storage/messages/ThreadMessageOperations.kt (Module: com.fsck.k9.storage.messages.ThreadMessageOperations). The predicted root cause reason is that ThreadInfo.messageIdHeader was declared as a non-null String and the code did not handle messages missing a Message-ID header (missing nullability/handling for a null message-id), causing the move/delete logic to fail for messages without a Message-ID."
iSoron#uhabits#296,"In the uhabits app, users reported that the Android application (v1.7.1) still crashes intermittently despite a previous fix; a crash report was attached and the problem was occurring during normal use. Your task is to identify the root cause component and root cause reason.","The predicted root cause component is uhabits-android/build.gradle.kts (module: uhabits-android.build.gradle.kts). The predicted root cause reason is an outdated/incompatible dependency configuration: the project was using an older AppIntro library version (com.github.paolorotolo:appintro:3.4.0) (and required Kotlin compatibility), which caused intermittent crashes; the issue was fixed by updating the AppIntro dependency to 4.1.0 (and bumping Kotlin to 1.5.0)."
aniyomiorg#aniyomi#1930,"In aniyomi, there was an issue where attempting to download anime episodes would fail partway through (around ~18%), report ""Downloaded file not found, retrying.."" and repeatedly restart the download process while manga downloads remained fine. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/data/download/anime/AnimeDownloader.kt (class/module: eu.kanade.tachiyomi.data.download.anime.AnimeDownloader). The predicted root cause reason is a filename/extension mismatch between what the downloader expects and what ffmpeg produces (wrong tmp/output filename or extension), causing the downloader to look for a non-existent file and repeatedly retry."
aniyomiorg#aniyomi#1882,"In the aniyomi repository/app, when an episode is played the app can freeze and become unresponsive after the player switches to horizontal mode, requiring a force close. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: determine which file or module was responsible for the failure and explain what went wrong (the underlying bug or missing condition) that led to the app hanging.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/player/controls/PlayerControls.kt (module: eu.kanade.tachiyomi.ui.player.controls.PlayerControls). The predicted root cause reason is a null-pointer related bug: code attempted to show the episode list or access the anime's displayMode when the current anime was null (missing null checks / use of non-null assertion), causing an NPE / invalid state that led to the app becoming unresponsive."
aniyomiorg#aniyomi#1626,"In the aniyomi app, users reported that opening Advanced Player settings and trying to modify mpv config, mpv input, or enabling mpv scripts causes the app to crash on Android 10 and below. This happens when interacting with those three preferences in the Advanced Player settings screen. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: which file/module contained the bug, and what specifically went wrong that caused the crash on older Android versions.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/presentation/more/settings/screen/AdvancedPlayerSettingsScreen.kt (module: eu.kanade.presentation.more.settings.screen.AdvancedPlayerSettingsScreen). The predicted root cause reason is calling Environment.isExternalStorageManager() (an API introduced in Android 11 / API 30) without guarding by the platform SDK level, causing a runtime crash on Android 10 and below (missing API-level check / incompatible API usage leading to a runtime error)."
bmax121#APatch#297,"In the APatch repository/app, users reported that on a device running Android 14 the app was effectively broken: granting su permissions and using libsu failed, modules could not be installed (the modules install page was blank and exporting install logs reported file-not-found), and APatch logs could not be exported or opened. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason.",The predicted root cause component is apd/Cargo.toml and apd/Cargo.lock (module: apd.procfs / apd.CargoToml & apd.CargoLock). The predicted root cause reason is an incompatible/outdated Rust dependency version (procfs and related Rust crates) declared in the apd Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock — a dependency version mismatch that caused runtime/compatibility failures on Android 14 (fixed by updating the procfs and other Rust crate versions).
mostafaalagamy#Metrolist#1702,"In Metrolist (app), there was an intermittent bug where the song cover shown in Discord Rich Presence would sometimes be replaced by the Metrolist fallback icon while playing a song (only happens sporadically, not every play). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to the cover image being replaced by the fallback icon.","The predicted root cause component is app/build.gradle.kts (module: app), specifically the org.jsoup dependency declaration. The predicted root cause reason is an outdated/buggy org.jsoup:jsoup version (1.18.1) causing intermittent failures when fetching/parsing the remote cover art (HTTP/parsing compatibility issue), resulting in the fallback Metrolist icon being used; upgrading jsoup to 1.19.1 fixes the issue."
home-assistant#android#4294,"In the Home Assistant Android app, users reported that when their phone switched networks (e.g., from home Wi‑Fi to mobile data or vice versa) the in‑app web view would lose connection and remain stuck on “Connection lost. Reconnecting...” until the app was fully closed and reopened. This happened when the app could reach the server via both an internal and an external URL but switching between them did not occur automatically on network change. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason responsible for this behavior.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/io/homeassistant/companion/android/webview/WebViewPresenterImpl.kt (io.homeassistant.companion.android.webview.WebViewPresenterImpl). The predicted root cause reason is that the logic deciding whether to reload the WebView failed to consider differences in URL protocol and port (i.e., an incomplete URL comparison), so the WebView was not reloaded when only protocol/port changed and remained pointed at the wrong endpoint until an app restart."
home-assistant#android#3893,"In the android repository app, there was an issue where service button widgets that require authentication on Android 14 QPR1+ did not open the authentication window when tapped — the widget appeared to do nothing because the authentication dialog was being dismissed immediately (sporadic repeated taps could sometimes bring it up). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/io/homeassistant/companion/android/widgets/common/WidgetAuthenticationActivity.kt (io.homeassistant.companion.android.widgets.common.WidgetAuthenticationActivity). The predicted root cause reason is that the biometric/authentication flow was started before the activity window was in the foreground (triggered too early, e.g., in onCreate), causing the system on Android 14 QPR1+ to immediately cancel the authentication dialog; there was no focus check/guard (and no flag to prevent re-triggering) to wait for the window to be foregrounded."
home-assistant#android#3770,"In the android repository/app, there was a crash that occurred whenever the user selected ""Android Auto Favourites"" or the Quick Settings Tiles — the app immediately restarts (~1 second) and the list does not populate. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason",The predicted root cause component is gradle/libs.versions.toml (Module: gradle.libs.versions.toml). The predicted root cause reason is an issue with the kotlinx-coroutines dependency version (outdated/buggy kotlinx-coroutines 1.8.1) causing runtime crashes — fixed by upgrading to kotlinx-coroutines 1.9.0.
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7649,"In AntennaPod, there was a crash when opening a podcast's settings screen after tapping the gear icon; your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/ui/screen/feed/preferences/FeedSettingsFragment.java (Module: de.danoeh.antennapod.ui.screen.feed.preferences.FeedSettingsFragment.FeedSettingsPreferenceFragment). The predicted root cause reason is a preference migration/type mismatch: an old stored boolean preference (from a checkbox) remained under the old key while the UI was migrated to use a ListPreference expecting String values, causing a ClassCastException / failed conversion when reading the stored value (i.e., missing handling/migration for the changed preference key/type)."
topjohnwu#Magisk#9050,"In the Magisk repository/app, when a user sets ""Superuser Access"" to ""Disabled"" in Settings the Magisk app stops recognising the manager and displays ""Installed: N/A""; the manager entry and the ""Superuser Access"" option then disappear so the user cannot reset it. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is native/src/core/su/daemon.rs (module: native.src.core.su.daemon). The predicted root cause reason is a logic/ordering bug: the code checks the global RootAccess::Disabled state and returns before applying a manager-bypass check, so the manager process is denied when Superuser Access is disabled (missing/incorrect ordering of the manager bypass check)."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7276,"In the AntennaPod app, users reported that when attempting to cast playback to another device the playback would stop on the source device and the casted playback would only produce a very short sound before immediately pausing; playback could not be resumed on either device and the app had to be restarted. This happens while using the in-app cast control after opening the player. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this behavior. In particular, name the file/module responsible and explain what went wrong (e.g., which action or missing check caused the casting playback to be cancelled and require an app restart).","The predicted root cause component is playback/service/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/playback/service/PlaybackService.java (module: de.danoeh.antennapod.playback.service.PlaybackService). The predicted root cause reason is an unconditional call to stop local playback in onStop (mediaPlayer.stopPlayback(true)) even while casting — missing a check for the casting state (mediaPlayer.isCasting()), which cancels/invalidates the cast playback and leads to the playback state becoming null/unrecoverable."
xchacha20-poly1305#husi#375,"In the husi repository/app, there was a bug where a routing rule that was created to target specific installed apps (for example, “App A -> block”) became globally effective after those targeted apps were uninstalled — after uninstalling the apps and restarting the VPN service the rule turned into a global block (an unconditional reject entry). Your task is to identify the root cause component (which file/module was responsible) and the root cause reason (what went wrong that allowed an app-scoped rule to turn into a global rule).","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/io/nekohasekai/sagernet/fmt/ConfigBuilder.kt (module: io.nekohasekai.sagernet.fmt, symbol: ConfigBuilderKt). The predicted root cause reason is a missing guard when resolving package-specific rules: when a rule referenced packages but none of those packages were installed the UID list became empty and the builder still emitted a rule without any UID/package constraint, effectively turning an app-specific rule into a global rule (i.e., missing skip/check for rules whose referenced packages are all uninstalled)."
openhab#openhab-android#2890,"In the openhab-android app, users reported that a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra regularly sent false upcoming alarm times to the server. The app log shows the alarm handling code receiving an alarm event where the 'sender' is null and then scheduling an alarm update.

The predicted root cause reason is a missing null check for the alarm sender (creatorPackage); when sender was null it was not treated as an ignored source and the alarm trigger time was forwarded, causing false alarm updates to be sent."
seedvault-app#seedvault#830,"In the seedvault app, users observed that when removable storage was attached the app and file backup processes were sometimes started at the same time (two notifications appear — one for file backup and one for app backup) and the backup always failed. This happened during the USB-attached flow (not when triggering a backup manually). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/com/stevesoltys/seedvault/UsbIntentReceiver.kt (Module: com.stevesoltys.seedvault.UsbIntentReceiver). The predicted root cause reason is that the USB attach BroadcastReceiver handled storage-availability monitoring and triggered backups directly (it used a ContentObserver / monitored status from the receiver), which allowed duplicate/overlapping backup requests — causing app and file backups to be started concurrently (a timing/architecture bug: using a ContentObserver/backup trigger from a BroadcastReceiver leads to simultaneous backup launches)."
meshtastic#Meshtastic-Android#4,"In Meshtastic-Android, leaving the phone connected to a t-beam sometimes caused the app to lose the connection: the app abandoned reconnect attempts and the UI did not show the expected ""battery saver mode"" state nor properly queue outbound packets. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason. Specifically, investigate which file/module is responsible for the failing reconnect/init logic and explain what went wrong (the underlying bug or missing handling) that caused the reconnect to be abandoned and outbound packets not to be queued.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/com/geeksville/mesh/service/MeshService.kt (module: com.geeksville.mesh.service.MeshService). The predicted root cause reason is that the BLE reconnection/init code attempted to read a characteristic immediately and did not handle a GATT failure/status=1 (i.e., attempted BLE reads while the link/device was in a low-power/NB state). Missing error handling/retry and missing logic to tolerate or queue operations while in battery-saver (NB) state caused the reconnect attempt to be abandoned and outbound packets not to be queued."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7866,"In AntennaPod, there was a crash when using the Add podcast flow: tapping ""Search fyyd"", entering a query and pressing Enter caused the app to crash instead of displaying search results. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/proguard.cfg (module: app). The predicted root cause reason is missing ProGuard keep rules that caused required RxJava and fyyd client classes (e.g., io.reactivex.Single and de.mfietz.fyydlin.*) to be removed during minification, leading to failure when creating the Retrofit/RxJava call adapter."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7313,"In AntennaPod, there was a bug where selecting “export database” caused the screen to go blank for a few seconds and then returned the user to the app settings without showing a file save / file picker dialog. This was observed when attempting to export the database to move to a new device.

AntennaPod#AntennaPod#5723,"In the AntennaPod app, when a user added a local folder, started playback, and then tapped the drawer control to play the next item, the next local file sometimes did not start playing (nothing happened). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason. In particular, name the file/module that needed to be changed and explain why the app failed to start playback of the local file (what went wrong logically).","The predicted root cause component is core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/service/playback/PlaybackService.java (module: de.danoeh.antennapod.core.service.playback.PlaybackService) and the related starter helper core/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/core/util/playback/PlaybackServiceStarter.java (module: de.danoeh.antennapod.core.util.playback.PlaybackServiceStarter). The predicted root cause reason is that the decision whether to stream was being conveyed via an intent/caller-side flag (the shouldStream extra) and handled inconsistently, causing local content to be treated as a stream (or blocked) when streaming was not allowed. In short: streaming logic was delegated to callers (and/or used a wrong default) instead of being decided centrally, so the service sometimes refused to play available local files."

Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to these crashes.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/com/stario/launcher/ui/icons/AdaptiveIconView.java (module: com.stario.launcher.ui.icons.AdaptiveIconView). The predicted root cause reason is that the view attempted to draw AdaptiveIconDrawable parts without checking for null (calling draw() on a null background or foreground Drawable), causing a NullPointerException during onDraw while scrolling."
