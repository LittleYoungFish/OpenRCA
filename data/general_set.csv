wordpress-mobile#WordPress-Android#11296,"In WordPress-Android, there was a bug where rotating the device while taking a photo to add to an Image block causes the captured photo to fail to upload and the app shows the error message “The media item couldn’t be retrieved”. This reliably happens when the user selects “Take a photo”, rotates the device during capture (triggering an activity recreation), then captures and confirms the photo. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason.","The predicted root cause component is WordPress/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/ui/posts/EditPostActivity.java (module: org.wordpress.android.ui.posts.EditPostActivity). The predicted root cause reason is that the media capture path (mMediaCapturePath) was not persisted across activity recreation on orientation change — missing save/restore of the capture path in onSaveInstanceState/onRestoreInstanceState, causing the app to lose the path to the captured photo and fail to process/upload it."
wordpress-mobile#WordPress-Android#11204,"In WordPress-Android, tapping multiple bottom tabs at the same time (for example pressing the “Reader” and the “Notifications” buttons simultaneously after logging in) causes the app to crash instead of selecting one of the tabs or doing nothing. This reliably reproduces on several devices. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this crash.","The predicted root cause component is WordPress/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/ui/reader/ReaderPostListFragment.java (class: org.wordpress.android.ui.reader.ReaderPostListFragment). The predicted root cause reason is use of an invalid/view-tied Context (container.getContext()) and related resource access after the view may have been destroyed; a wrong context was stored/used instead of the fragment's stable context/getResources(), causing a crash when tabs were selected simultaneously."
wordpress-mobile#WordPress-Android#10407,"In WordPress-Android, there was a crash in the editor when restoring activity state after navigating to the History tab. With ""Don't keep activities"" enabled, a user edits a published post, opens Options → History, backgrounds the app while History is open, and then reopens the app — the editor crashes during state restoration. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this failure: which file/module is responsible and what went wrong to cause the crash.","The predicted root cause component is WordPress/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/ui/posts/EditPostActivity.java (module: org.wordpress.android.ui.posts.EditPostActivity). The predicted root cause reason is that the ViewPager offscreen page limit was too low after the adapter gained more pages (offscreenPageLimit set to 3 while adapter has 5 pages), so the editor fragment was not retained/instantiated on restore. This led to code accessing UI/state on a null fragment/toolbar (NullPointerException/state accessed before initialization)."
wordpress-mobile#WordPress-Android#8726,"In WordPress-Android, there was an app crash that occurred when a user opened the editor, collapsed the top toolbar (if expanded), and then tapped the three-dots (overflow) button in the bottom Aztec editor toolbar while composing a new post. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is libs/editor/WordPressEditor/src/main/res/layout/fragment_aztec_editor.xml (WordPressEditor module: libs/editor/WordPressEditor). The predicted root cause reason is a missing XML attribute for the Aztec toolbar (the aztec:mediaToolbarAvailable flag was not specified), causing the toolbar to be initialized without the expected mediaToolbarAvailable state and leading to a crash when the three-dots action tried to use that state."
wordpress-mobile#WordPress-Android#1487,"In WordPress-Android, users who host sites on shared SSL certificates could not log in: when the server presented a certificate whose name did not match the blog domain (SNI/hostname mismatch), the app failed with a generic ""We can't log you in"" flow and did not offer the same ability to proceed/accept the certificate that a browser provides. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is src/org/xmlrpc/android/TrustUserSSLCertsSocketFactory.java (Module: org.xmlrpc.android.TrustUserSSLCertsSocketFactory). The predicted root cause reason is overly strict hostname verification (use of a StrictHostnameVerifier / no BrowserCompat-style verification) and lack of a fallback to check and trust the presented X509 certificate against the app's SSL trust store when hostname verification fails, causing the SSL handshake to be aborted for shared-cert (name-mismatch) sites."
bluesky-social#social-app#7882,"In social-app, there was an issue where the unread-message indicator for a conversation would briefly show a single unread message after opening or refreshing the app/window, then disappear moments later. This happened after interacting with a conversation and receiving a new message; on startup the UI would flicker an unread badge even though the convo's unread count was 0. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this transient unread notification behavior.","The predicted root cause component is src/state/messages/events/agent.ts (module: src.state.messages.events.agent.MessagesEventBus). The predicted root cause reason is incorrect initialization of the log-polling state: the poller was started using the wrong basis (leading to initializing latestRev incorrectly), which caused a backlog of historical/non-embodied log events to be processed at startup and produced transient unread/optimistic updates. In short, improper initialization of latestRev using the wrong API/value caused startup processing of past logs and the flickering unread notification."
element-hq#element-x-android#5505,"In element-x-android, there was a bug where an incoming call's UI and ringtone would disappear very quickly (often in 10-15 seconds or even under 1 second) on certain devices when the phone was locked and the call was not answered, making the incoming call unusable. Your task is to identify the root cause component (file/module) and the root cause reason for this behavior.","The predicted root cause component is features/call/impl/src/main/kotlin/io/element/android/features/call/impl/utils/ActiveCallManager.kt (module/class: io.element.android.features.call.impl.utils.DefaultActiveCallManager). The predicted root cause reason is that the flow handling of the ringing/activeCall state filtered out null values before flatMapLatest, so transitions to ""no active call"" were never emitted and previous flatMapLatest inner coroutines were not cancelled; this allowed lingering inner flows/timers to run and prematurely stop/dismiss the incoming call UI and ringtone (missing proper cancellation/cleanup when activeCall becomes null)."
element-hq#element-x-android#3361,"In the element-x-android repository, building the app for F-Droid failed: CI reported a reproducibility/build mismatch where a generated resource file (third_party_license_metadata) differed between variants (gplay vs fdroid), causing the F‑Droid build to be rejected. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason",The predicted root cause component is app/build.gradle.kts (Module: app.build.gradle.kts). The predicted root cause reason is use of the Google OSS Licenses Gradle plugin which produced non-deterministic / variant-specific generated license metadata (ordering/format differences) leading to reproducibility/build mismatches; replacing it with a deterministic license-generation solution and per-variant copy tasks fixed the issue.
nextcloud#talk-android#3117,"In talk-android, opening a conversation on a Samsung Galaxy S9+ running Android 10 caused the app to crash: the chat starts loading but after a second or two the app returns to the conversation overview and the conversation cannot be opened. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/build.gradle (module: app). The predicted root cause reason is a dependency version issue: incompatible / mismatched Mockito dependency versions (org.mockito:mockito-core vs org.mockito:mockito-android) that needed to be bumped/aligned, causing the crash."
nextcloud#talk-android#1889,"In the talk-android app, call setup was flaky: when a call was started from the Android client and accepted in a web browser, sometimes the web could hear Android but Android could not hear the web and no remote participant appeared. Debugging showed that no SDP offer from the browser was ever received on Android, so the MediaStreamEvent never fired. Your task is to identify the root cause component (file/module) and the root cause reason that allowed this to happen.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/com/nextcloud/talk/activities/CallActivity.java (Module: com.nextcloud.talk.activities.CallActivity). The predicted root cause reason is premature/incorrect creation of PeerConnectionWrapper instances (creating connections for arbitrary signaling messages instead of only when an offer is expected), causing a race/invalid connection state and resulting in no offer being received from the browser."
nextcloud#talk-android#1498,"In the talk-android app, users reported that when User 1 sent a Talk message to User 2, User 2 received no pop-up notification on their Android device even though a notification was expected. Your task is to identify the root cause component (file or module) and the root cause reason for this failure.",The predicted root cause component is app/build.gradle (Module: app.build.gradle). The predicted root cause reason is an outdated/mismatched test dependency: mockito-core was pinned to 4.10.0 (a test dependency version issue) and was bumped to 4.11.0 to address the problem.
nextcloud#talk-android#692,"In talk-android, there was a crash when a user tried to join a video call on a second Android device. In the reported scenario, User A starts a video call; User B opens the chat with User A and taps the ""video call"" button, and the Nextcloud Talk app on User B's device immediately crashes. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason.","The predicted root cause component is app/build.gradle (Module: app.build.gradle) — the joda-time dependency declaration that was changed. The predicted root cause reason is a bug in the third-party joda-time library (the earlier version 2.12.2) causing a runtime crash on certain Android devices/versions; the issue was resolved by upgrading joda-time to 2.12.4 (i.e., a faulty/outdated dependency causing the crash)."
nextcloud#talk-android#712,"In talk-android, there was a problem where after upgrading the server and using the Android Nextcloud Talk app, Android devices did not receive any push notifications: chat messages appeared in the conversation but produced no notification, and incoming calls did not make the device ring. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this lack of notifications.","The predicted root cause component is app/build.gradle (module: app) — specifically the dependency com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core (version pinned in this Gradle file). The predicted root cause reason is an issue with the Jackson core dependency version (outdated/buggy jackson-core 2.12.4) causing incorrect JSON deserialization/handling of push/call payloads (i.e., a dependency-version-related parsing bug), which was resolved by bumping jackson-core to 2.12.5."
trezor#trezor-suite#20796,"In trezor-suite, after completing a firmware installation during onboarding the app became stuck on a “Device connected” screen and the user could not continue. The firmware was actually installed, but the Suite UI never proceeded — even after restarting the app the same blocking “Device connected” screen remained. This happened reliably on one machine (and intermittently on others); in one run a Bluetooth pairing screen appeared instead of the stuck screen. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that caused the app to hang on the “Device connected” screen after firmware installation.","The predicted root cause component is packages/connect/src/core/onCallFirmwareUpdate.ts (module: packages.connect.src.core.onCallFirmwareUpdate). The predicted root cause reason is a missing reference/argument for postMessage passed into getRebootMethod (postMessage was not provided), causing a runtime error in the reboot/wait-for-reconnect logic and preventing the reconnect flow from completing."
trezor#trezor-suite#9608,"In trezor-suite, there was a bug where after reinstalling or updating a Trezor T's firmware (≥2.6.0) via Suite, the app appears to have the device connected but becomes mostly unusable: device-related UI like ""+ Add wallet"" behaves as if no device is available. This happens immediately after following the on-device firmware reinstall/update flow. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that lead to Suite not fully recognizing the device after the firmware reinstall.","The predicted root cause component is packages/connect/src/core/index.ts (Module: packages.connect.src.core.index). The predicted root cause reason is an unhandled error thrown when rebooting the Model T into bootloader (device.run throws on disconnect), i.e., missing error handling/try-catch causing subsequent cleanup/lock-removal logic not to run."
trezor#trezor-suite#8756,"In the trezor-suite repository/app, users observed that Coinjoin discovery progress sometimes goes backwards (progress decreases unexpectedly). This happened in scenarios such as when a user created a Coinjoin account and immediately opened the device selection/modal, after which discovery progress regressed. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason responsible for this incorrect progress behavior.","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/actions/wallet/coinjoinAccountActions.ts (module: packages.suite.src.actions.wallet.coinjoinAccountActions). The predicted root cause reason is a reentrancy/race condition: fetchAndUpdateAccount used stale/passed-in account data and performed a syncing check before re-reading the current account state, allowing Coinjoin discovery to be started twice in parallel (missing fresh state re-fetch/guard resulting in duplicate session starts)."
trezor#trezor-suite#8658,"In trezor-suite, there was an issue where the CoinJoin custom setup page became effectively unresponsive: after finishing discovery of a coinjoin account in the 23.6.1 release candidate, users could not change the mining fee or privacy level from the settings UI (controls did not respond). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is the proxy-memoize dependency referenced in package manifests (e.g. packages/suite/package.json (Module: packages.suite.package) and suite-common/wallet-core/package.json (Module: suite-common.wallet-core.package) — and other package.json entries / yarn.lock where proxy-memoize was updated). The predicted root cause reason is an upgrade/regression in the proxy-memoize library (upgrade to 2.0.4) that broke selector memoization, leading to stale/incorrect selector results and UI state not updating (memoized selectors returning wrong/stale values), causing the CoinJoin settings UI to be unresponsive."
trezor#trezor-suite#6852,"In trezor-suite, there was a bug where starting CoinJoin while Tor was in the process of starting (Tor handshake not yet fully finalized) caused the UI to show the ""Enable Tor for CoinJoin"" modal stuck at 0% and block the CoinJoin flow. From a user perspective: if Tor is started just before opening CoinJoin, the modal never progresses and the flow cannot continue. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/components/suite/modals/RequestEnableTor.tsx (module: packages.suite.src.components.suite.modals.RequestEnableTor). The predicted root cause reason is that the modal did not handle the Tor ""enabling/loading"" state (it only checked whether Tor was already enabled), i.e., missing/incorrect handling of tor status/progress (missing isTorLoading detection or progress reflection), so the UI never reflected an in-progress Tor startup and failed to auto-close or continue when Tor became enabled."
trezor#trezor-suite#4233,"In the trezor-suite app, there was a problem during a firmware update of a Trezor Model One: after being prompted to reboot the device to bootloader and confirming on the device, the suite failed to detect the device in bootloader mode (reconnecting the device did not make the bootloader appear). This happened reproducibly on some macOS machines but not on others. Your task is to identify the root cause component (which file or module was responsible) and the root cause reason (what went wrong conceptually).","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/hooks/firmware/useRebootRequest.ts (module: packages.suite.src.hooks.firmware.useRebootRequest). The predicted root cause reason is that the hook selected an automatic reboot mode for Trezor Model One (i.e., returning 'automatic' for that firmware range), causing an unreliable auto-reboot/bootloader detection on affected macOS systems; the automatic reboot behavior needed to be disabled/changed to 'manual'."
trezor#trezor-suite#4129,"In the trezor-suite repository/app, there was a firmware update bug where, when updating a device running firmware older than 1.6.3 (and the device was already initialized), the Suite repeatedly installed only the intermediary firmware (1.10.0) and never completed the update to the latest firmware (1.10.2). Your task is to identify the root cause component (file/module) and the root cause reason for this behavior.","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/reducers/firmware/firmwareReducer.ts (module: packages.suite.src.reducers.firmware.firmwareReducer). The predicted root cause reason is that the firmware update state (targetRelease) was not updated/reset after the intermediary firmware was installed — i.e., missing state update to set the target release to the latest version (or reset when transitioning), causing the updater to repeatedly select/install the intermediary firmware."
trezor#trezor-suite#4101,"In trezor-suite, there was an unhandled error during a firmware update on a Model One device: when the user aborted the firmware installation by pressing the device button (or reconnecting in bootloader and then aborting), Suite displayed an error and the firmware update flow failed. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is the trezor-connect iframe bundle included in the app (packages/suite-data/files/connect/js/iframe.c177a20ab3c1b068663c.js — the trezor-connect module / iframe script packaged under packages/suite-data/files/connect/js, later replaced by iframe.a8737f59423666392ed3.js). The predicted root cause reason is incorrect/insufficient error handling in the connect iframe: the firmware-abort path produced a null/undefined error object and the code accessed error.code (or similar) without a null check, causing an unhandled TypeError (missing null-check / improper error normalization)."
trezor#trezor-suite#4096,"In trezor-suite, there was a bug in the Trade/Exchange UI: if a user types non-numeric text into the crypto amount input and then presses the 'All' (or a fraction) button, the app kicks off the 'Compare offers' process which never completes and appears to run indefinitely. Your task is to identify the root cause component (which file/module was responsible) and the root cause reason (what went wrong) that allowed this behavior to occur.","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/views/wallet/coinmarket/exchange/components/ExchangeForm/Inputs/index.tsx (module: packages.suite.src.views.wallet.coinmarket.exchange.components.ExchangeForm.Inputs) and also the analogous sell component packages/suite/src/views/wallet/coinmarket/sell/components/SellForm/Inputs/index.tsx (module: packages.suite.src.views.wallet.coinmarket.sell.components.SellForm.Inputs). The predicted root cause reason is that the code did not clear/reset the crypto/output amount input when the user pressed 'All' (missing setValue to empty the input), leaving non-numeric text in the form state; this invalid value was then used by the compose/compare-offers flow and caused the compare-offers process to run indefinitely (state with invalid input not handled/validated)."
trezor#trezor-suite#3915,"In trezor-suite, the app crashes when a user connects a device running firmware 1.6.0 while Suite is asking to connect a device (this happens during onboarding and when Suite is already started). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this crash.","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/components/firmware/FirmwareInitial.tsx (Module: packages.suite.src.components.firmware.FirmwareInitial) and packages/suite/src/components/firmware/FirmwareInstallation.tsx (Module: packages.suite.src.components.firmware.FirmwareInstallation). The predicted root cause reason is that the code assumed a cachedDevice object was always present and accessed its properties without null/undefined checks (missing optional chaining / null check), causing a runtime error when cachedDevice was undefined."
trezor#trezor-suite#3534,"In the trezor-suite app, letting the application run idle for a long period (with a remembered wallet, transaction history and all coins enabled) caused the UI renderer to consume more and more memory and eventually the app became unusable when the renderer crashed from running out of memory. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that led to this failure: which file/module in the repository is associated with the fix introduced, and what was the underlying reason the renderer crashed and left the user unable to continue.",The predicted root cause component is packages/suite-desktop/src-electron/modules/crash-recover.ts (module: packages.suite-desktop.src-electron.modules.crash-recover). The predicted root cause reason is the renderer process running out of memory (OOM) — a memory leak / unbounded memory growth in the renderer leading to process termination and no prior recovery handling (renderer crash left the app unusable).
trezor#trezor-suite#3376,"In trezor-suite, typing into the Transaction history search input while the wallet is still discovering transactions causes the app's render process to crash and the Suite window to go completely white (the typed characters also do not appear). This happens when starting to type a long string immediately after opening an account with a long transaction history and discovery still running. Your task is to identify the root cause component (file/module) and the root cause reason for this failure.","The predicted root cause component is packages/suite/src/views/wallet/transactions/components/TransactionList/components/Actions/components/SearchAction/index.tsx (Module: packages.suite.src.views.wallet.transactions.components.TransactionList.components.Actions.components.SearchAction.index). The predicted root cause reason is an unguarded / inefficient ""fetch all"" search implementation that triggered heavy or repeated fetchTransactions calls on every keystroke during discovery (missing state/guard to prevent repeated fetches), causing excessive work and ultimately crashing the renderer (performance/state-management bug)."
ente-io#ente#1279,"In the ente repository/app, there was a failure: F‑Droid could not build the Ente Auth Android app. The failure appeared during the app build process (the problem surfaced around the authentication/two‑factor UI and related dependencies). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: which file or module was responsible and what specifically went wrong to cause the F‑Droid build to fail.",The predicted root cause component is auth/lib/ui/two_factor_authentication_page.dart (auth.lib.ui.two_factor_authentication_page.TwoFactorAuthenticationPage) and the related dependency specification in auth/pubspec.lock / auth/pubspec.yaml (the pinput package entry). The predicted root cause reason is an incompatible pinput package version / API change (mismatched widget/API usage between Pinput and the older PinPut API) causing a dependency/API incompatibility that broke the F‑Droid build.
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7877,"In the AntennaPod app, there was a bug where after entering multi-select in the Queue, tapping the Select All action and then pulling down to refresh the list, the app became unresponsive (UI froze / stopped responding). Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/ui/episodeslist/EpisodeItemListAdapter.java (module: de.danoeh.antennapod.ui.episodeslist.EpisodeItemListAdapter). The predicted root cause reason is that the adapter removed/failed to provide a click handler for the item's secondary action button while in action mode (setOnClickListener(null)), so selection toggling was missing/incorrect — a missing click listener / missing toggle-selection behavior that caused inconsistent selection state and led to the UI becoming unresponsive during refresh."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7813,"In the AntennaPod app, there was a security issue where an external app could cause AntennaPod to add podcast subscriptions or import feeds without the user's knowledge or consent simply by sending a broadcast intent. This could happen during normal app startup or when AntennaPod queried for feeds. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason: which file/module in the codebase allowed this to happen and what went wrong that enabled unauthorized subscriptions/imports.","The predicted root cause component is app/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/spa/SPAReceiver.java (Module: de.danoeh.antennapod.spa.SPAReceiver) — additionally the receiver declaration in app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and the SPA-related utility/call in app/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/PodcastApp.java (Module: de.danoeh.antennapod.PodcastApp / de.danoeh.antennapod.spa.SPAUtil) are part of the vulnerable flow. The predicted root cause reason is that an exported BroadcastReceiver accepted and processed untrusted broadcast intents (and their extras) without validation or authorization (no permission checks / missing input validation), which allowed arbitrary apps to supply feed URLs that were imported/added silently into the app."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7743,"In the AntennaPod app, users observed that many network requests were missing or using the wrong User-Agent header (for example when tapping the download button or viewing the subscription screen). This can be reproduced by running the app and inspecting outgoing HTTP request headers — the User-Agent is absent in various places, potentially causing under-reporting of app usage. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason responsible for the User-Agent not being sent consistently.","The predicted root cause component is net/common/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/net/common/AntennapodHttpClient.java (module: de.danoeh.antennapod.net.common.AntennapodHttpClient) and ui/glide/src/main/java/de/danoeh/antennapod/ui/glide/ApOkHttpUrlLoader.java (module: de.danoeh.antennapod.ui.glide.ApOkHttpUrlLoader). The predicted root cause reason is that the User-Agent interceptor was not applied to all HTTP clients: it was registered as a network interceptor (and thus not applied in all request flows) and the Glide-specific OkHttp client did not include the UserAgentInterceptor, so some requests were sent without the User-Agent header (missing/incorrectly registered interceptor)."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#7244,"In AntennaPod, there was a problem where attempting to configure Nextcloud synchronization in Settings produced an unhelpful authentication failure: after entering a host and trying to log in the app did not present clear, actionable information (for example that a required Nextcloud/gpoddersync plugin might be missing).

The predicted root cause reason is that the fragment's error handling did not surface a user-friendly generic message—errors were only shown via an inline/hidden error view or as raw text, so users were not informed to check network/server address or to install the gpoddersync Nextcloud plugin (missing/insufficient error presentation)."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#5574,"In the AntennaPod app, right-clicking (using a mouse) on an episode to open the context menu often caused the app to crash, whereas long-pressing the same item worked fine. The crash happened when trying to open the episode menu via a right-click; after opening the menu once with a long-press, subsequent right-clicks would sometimes stop crashing.

The predicted root cause reason is a threading/concurrency bug in the seek-completion handling: the seek-complete logic spawned/used separate threads (and invoked callbacks while holding locks/using seekLatch) which led to races/deadlocks around playerLock/seekLatch and callbacks being run on the wrong thread, causing the app to freeze."
AntennaPod#AntennaPod#3186,"In AntennaPod, the app sometimes crashes when playback is resumed after being paused by an incoming call on bluetooth or wired headphones — the user flow is: start playback on headphones, get a call which pauses playback, keep the call long (about 10 minutes) so the interruption is long, then end the call and the app crashes as it tries to restart playback.

The predicted root cause reason is that audio-focus/audio callbacks remained registered after the playback service was stopped/killed, so audio focus change callbacks were delivered to a destroyed service whose executors had been shut down (i.e., listeners not removed / audio focus not abandoned), causing the app to crash."
Expensify#App#65466,"In App, there was a crash when performing a basic export from the Report Actions menu: after selecting one or more expenses on a report (tap-and-hold → Select → choose items) and then choosing the Download/Export option from the actions menu, the app crashed. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason","The predicted root cause component is src/hooks/useSelectedTransactionsActions.ts (module: src.hooks.useSelectedTransactionsActions).

linagora#tmail-flutter#3370,"In tmail-flutter, there was a failure when selecting and moving a very large number of emails (1000+). When the user tried to move the large selection, the app sent the move request and the backend refused to process it due to the request containing too many items. Your task is to identify the root cause component and reason that allowed the app to send that oversized request instead of performing the operation in smaller batches or respecting the server limits.
